            <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Not the edible kind, sadly. These are small files that help us improve your experience. If you would like to give her real cookies, donate more to Benita.</li>

            <li>To send you heartwarming updates about Benita’s full belly and happy face.</li>
            <li>To occasionally ask for more donations because, let’s face it, Benita eats a lot.</li>
            <li>To improve our website so you enjoy visiting as much as Benita enjoys her wings and poult mayo.</li>

        <h2 class="fw-bold">Third Parties</h2>
        <p>
            We might work with third parties (like payment processors) to make sure your donations get straight to Benita’s plate. These parties are required to be just as nice and trustworthy as us.
